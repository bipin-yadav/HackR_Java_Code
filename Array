An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.

You'll be given an array of NN integers, and you have to print the integers in reverse order.

Note: If you have already solved the problem "Arrays Introduction" in the Introduction chapter of the C++ domain, you may skip this challenge.

Input Format

The first line of input contains NN, the number of integers. The next line contains NN integers separated by a space.

Constraints

1<=N<=10001<=N<=1000
1<=Ai<=100001<=Ai<=10000, where AiAi is the ithith integer in the array.

Output Format

Print the NN integers of the array in the reverse order on a single line separated by single spaces.
